---
🔭 I am a fifth year Engineering Physics student (computer engineering focused) at the University of British Columbia.

💻 In my time as a student, I have had several software engineering roles and have done multiple software-related projects. During this time, I have learned that sometimes it is best to just dive into a problem rather than worrying and doubting. Also, making your code readable to other people is helpful for the team and your future self.

🌱 I’m currently developing several full stack projects: An Android application and digital business cards

✨ I also contributed to several open source projects like: spaCy, Sci-spaCy, and MlFlow

🏀 I enjoy playing basketball, soccer, badminton, and watching F1
