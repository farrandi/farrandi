ðŸ”­ I am a fourth year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia. I am focused in the computer engineering aspects of the program.

ðŸ’» In my time as a student, I have had several software engineering roles and have done multiple software-related projects. During this time, I have learned that sometimes it is best to just dive into a problem rather than worrying and doubting. Also, making your code readable to other people is helpful for the team and your future self.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing several full stack projects: amazon clone (you can check it out in this github), and an Android application
